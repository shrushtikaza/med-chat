# MedChat - AI Healthcare Assistant

## Overview
MedChat is an intelligent, speech-assisted healthcare assistant that helps patients navigate their medical needs by analyzing symptoms and providing personalized recommendations. Using NLP and other AI tools, MedChat bridges the gap between patient concerns and appropriate medical care.

## Technology Stack
- **Speech Recognition**: `speech_recognition` library for voice input processing
- **Text-to-Speech**: `pyttsx3` and `gTTS` for audio output
- **Audio Processing**: `pygame` for audio playback
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn` with TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- **NLP**: Hugging Face `transformers` for advanced language understanding
- **Data Processing**: `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: Captures user input via speech recognition or text
2. **Symptom Analysis**: Uses NLP and machine learning to analyze symptoms
3. **Specialist Matching**: Matches symptoms to appropriate medical specialties using TF-IDF vectorization
4. **Response Generation**: Provides recommendations via text and speech output

## Future Enhancements

1. Connect patients with nearby hospitals and clinics based on their location and medical needs
2. Integration with real-time hospital availability APIs
3. Symptom severity assessment
4. Integration with telemedicine platforms
